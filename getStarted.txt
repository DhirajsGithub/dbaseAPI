Run the server with:
$ uvicorn main:app --reload


NOTE: uvicorn main:app --reload 
main is same as server.js and app is the instance, 
so define main.py(module) and app according to uvicorn main:app --reload

function name can be same, only matters is the instance and decorators


Problems of network with react native 
run the server on specifi host and port 

$ ifconfig 
find the ip address of your network


$ uvicorn server:app --host 10.196.6.58 --port 8000
we are running on host 10.196.6.58 and port 8000 let say
then fetch data as http://10.196.6.58:8000/
